A.  Describe a real-world organizational situation or issue in the Data Dictionary you chose, by doing the following:

1.  Provide one question that is relevant to your chosen data set. You will answer this question later in the task through an analysis of the cleaned data, using one of the following techniques: chi-square, t-test, or analysis of variance (ANOVA).

The company has seen a rise in customer churn over the last month. The director of customer support has accused the sales department of lying in their pitches and over promising to potential customers on features or performance levels we are unable to fulfill. After seeing that those promised features are not available, the new customers inevitably leave the company, causing a rise in churn. The head of sales disagrees. He says that they are not overpromising and that the churning customers are both long time customers as well as newer ones who are leaving. They then reach out to you to determine: Is there a statistical difference in contract length of churned vs. non-churned customers?

1.  Explain how stakeholders in the organization could benefit from an analysis of the data.

Analyzing the average contract length of churning customers in comparison to non-churned customers helps to highlight key features of the churning population. The stakeholders will have a better understanding of who their customer population is that they are losing. This knowledge allows decision makers to correct failure points for this specific population, help those customers more effectively, and ultimately increase customer retention which benefits the bottom line.

1.  Identify all of the data in your data set that are relevant to answering your question in part A1.

All tests run to answer this question will use the *Churn* column which separates the data set into 2 populations. One of churned customers, and one of current customers. We will also use the *Tenure* Column to identify the length of a customers contract.


 

B.  Describe the data analysis by doing the following:

1.  Using one of the following techniques, write code (in either Python or R) to run the analysis of the data set:

•   chi-square

•   t-test

•   ANOVA

2.  Provide the output and the results of any calculations from the analysis you performed.

3.  Justify why you chose this analysis technique.
